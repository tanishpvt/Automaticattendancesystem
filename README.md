Abstract                                                                        

The main objective of the proposed project is to build a face recognition attendance system for monitoring the attendance of the students coming in contact with the camera.
Many problems arise when the authority is enable authorities regulation of the old attendance system.
The technology working behind will be the face recognition system.
It recognises the human face and records the attendance. It can be viewed on the users smartphone and get the monthly attendance file.
                
1.1	Introduction:

The main objective of this project is to develop face recognition based automated student attendance system.
 In order to achieve better performance, the test images and training images of this proposed approach are limited. 
The students’ data has been registered in the local database to be recognized. Second main aim is to get used to technology and reduce the use of books. 
This project helps in many ways and also is time saving. The attendance of the students gets marked as soon as the student enters the classroom with the time. It also makes sure that the student just doesn’t enter the class for the sake of attendance, it will also show the time of the student getting out of the class. Teachers can access the attendance on their smart phones through the application. And they can also manually take the attendance.

1.2	Problem statement and objective 

Traditionally student attendance marking technique is often facing a lot of trouble. The face recognition attendance system emphasizes its simplicity by eliminating classic student attendance marking technique. They are not only disturbing the teaching process but also causes distraction during exams. 
Hence, there is a need to develop a real time operating student attendance system. Which means the identification of students must be done within defined time constraints to prevent omission. High accuracy and fast computation time will be the evaluation points of the performance.

Main Objective 
The main objective of this project is to develop  face recognition based automated student attendance system.
To extract the useful features from the face detected.
To record the attendance of the identified student.
To not let the students misuse the system as the time of getting in and out are been recorded.

3.1 Introduction
       The basic ideology was to connect the proposed system to camera using (OpenCV) for preparing query from database to the received attendance record. Then preparing the whole layout and writing its appropriate code, and exceptions, and valuable methods.   

3.2 Architecture /Framework

1	Application gives us the opportunity to record attendance simultaneously as the student comes in contact with the camera.
2	Helps in automation of face recognition attendance system.
3	Application allows the user to get the record of the students getting in and out of the classroom with the time. 


3.3 Automations
1	The attendance gets recorded.
2	The attendance is recorded and being saved into the excel sheet. 
3	The data is automatically pushed to firebase in 24hrs.
4	The same data can be accessed on the smart phone through application.
5	If the proposed system is failed due to any reason one can switch to manual mode.
6	The proposed system can generate monthly attendance files.

3.5 Conclusion and Result

•	We created this system to save time.<br/>
•	Reduce the false attendance in the classroom.<br/>
•	Supports manual mode through .
